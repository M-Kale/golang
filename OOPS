Polymorphism
     Interfaces may embed other interfaces, this behavior is an aspect of interface polymorphism which is known as ad hoc polymorphism.
     When one type is embedded into another type, the methods of the embedded type are available to the embedding type.
     The method or methods of the embedded interface are accessible to the embedding interface.
